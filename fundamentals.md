# This is a review of the first five weeks of IT 0075 

## Concentration has been on syntax and algorithms

I have tried (mostly successfully) to hone fast algorithm development. 
   First by the use of specific comments that delineate the sections of code to be somewhat independently 
   written and debugged.
   
   I have used the Python IDLE (integrated development and learning environment). It has been easy
   to learn and very functional.
   
   
In conclusion, seems like Python is the most popular programming language. It is easy to learn, I look forward to 
progressing to the specific modules.

The first weeks of the Python class provided the needed underpinning of the language. It solidified the syntax and provided a taste of what was to come. Learning that Python was the current most popular programming language made it clear that this class was a very good choice. The IoT section started to show the pragmatic side of the language and noted the libraries available for use.

My intent with the last lab was to experiment with many of the tools available. Also to  make use of added devices such as higher voltage (6v). In general I try to make my start to finish code development as efficient as possible. 

Below is a picture of the last circuit using onboard accelerometer and external servo with 6v battery.

Again, the coding was challenging as a “class” definition was used, we had not reviewed that in class.

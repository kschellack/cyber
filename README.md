# cyber

Hi, I am Kurt Schellack. 

I am returning to college to renew my education. I have a Master of Electrical Engineering from Cornell University. My current studies are toward knowledge of Cyber Security. I have taken Security, Network and computer science classes.

Python seems to be a current, prevalent, versatile scripting language.  I hope to become fluent in Python.

As I have taken many programming classes in the past, I am suspecting I will do well. I took Intro to Linux last semester.

The most important thing in my life is to stay current in technology. In this rapid changing world I donâ€™t want to be left behind.

I have spent the last 40 years in the electronic industry, but I have a tremendous interest in woodworking and the outdoors (hiking, mountain climbing)
